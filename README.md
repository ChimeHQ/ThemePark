# ThemePark
A Swift library for working with syntax highlighting/IDE themes

Pretty much every editor has its own theming system. I'd love a package that could be used to intrepret a bunch of different themes for interoperability. I'm not sure how feasible this would be for all the things a theme can control, but I thought at a minimum it could be handy for syntax highlighting.

This is a repo to explore that possibility, and it is a work in progress.

## Contributing and Collaboration

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.
